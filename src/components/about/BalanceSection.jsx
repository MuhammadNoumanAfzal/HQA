          At Houston Quran Academy, our values and guiding principles are
          grounded in the Qur'an and Sunnah. We believe in nurturing
          well-rounded individuals through a balanced approach to spiritual,
          intellectual, emotional, and civic growth. Every belief we hold shapes
          a student's character, purpose, and contribution to the world—both as
          a Muslim and as a compassionate global citizen.
